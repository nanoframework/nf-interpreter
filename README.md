Welcome to the nanoFramework Interpreter repository!

## How to Engage, Contribute and Provide Feedback

Some of the best ways to contribute are to try things out, file bugs, and join in design conversations. 
If you are having issues or need a clarification about something, instead of opening an issue the best way is to start a conversation in one of our Slack channels.
Please select the one that's most appropriate to the matter you are facing.


If you've find a bug or can't use Slack, please open an issue at [Issues](https://github.com/nanoframework/nf-interpreter/issues).
We ask you to open an issue only when you have a real and confirmed one. Don't open an issue for support requests or to start a discussion. For that you'll get a better (and quicker!) support/feedback in one of the Slack channels.

Looking for something to work on? The list of [up-for-grabs issues](https://github.com/nanoframework/nf-interpreter/labels/up-for-grabs)
is a great place to start. Or take a look at our [documentation](docs/).
