/// NOTES: Why origin is at 1/1/1601.
/// Current civil calendar is named as Gregorian calendar after Pope Gregory XIII as he made adjustments
/// in 1582 (read more at wiki http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar). Rules governing
/// leap years were changed from then. Also in that year month October was 21 days instead of usual 31.
/// This poses a problem on calculating date/time difference, leap years etc before 1582 using simple math.
/// For example 1500 was a leap year using old method while it is not using new. But in reality, as part of the
/// history it was leap year. Default CLR origin 1/1/01 gives wrong date time from years before 1582. For example
/// dates like 10/6/1582 does exist in history (see wiki), while CLR managed date/time will not throw an exception
/// if you are to create that date. To stay safe side 1/1/1601 is taken as origin, as was done for Windows.
