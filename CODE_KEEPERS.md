The following is a list of keepers for different areas of the coreclr code. 
Each of the keepers is responsible for ensuring that changes in their areas 
are reviewed, either by themselves or by someone they designate, in 
addition to being the final word for the architecture and content of an area.

List sorted by last name and the fields are Name (N), GitHub user account (G), 
Area (A).

Note: If you don't find the area in the below list, or you have a general 
question, send a message to Stanislav Simicek (@cw2) and Richard Lander
(@richlander). They can ensure that the question gets forwarded to the
right person or answer it themselves.  

| Name | GitHub user | Area |
| --- | --- | --- |
| José Simões | @josesimoes | Native code build, VS Code Debug and CMake |
| Stanislav Simicek | @cw2 | Debug protocol, nano Framework Interpreter |

This list is incomplete, if you need to find other keepers please ping the team to get them filled in.
