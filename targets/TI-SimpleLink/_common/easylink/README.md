### Notes regarding the build system

The code files here are taken from the SDK folder: `ti\easylink`.
When new versions are made available these should be replaced with them.
The EasyLink configuration files (`easylink_config.c` and `.h`) are to be placed in each target folder **NOT** here. This allows each target to fine tune its configuration.
